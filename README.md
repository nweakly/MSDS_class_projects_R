# Projects in R

This repository contains examples of the learning projects I completed while working on the Master of Science in Data Science degree at the Regis University. Therefore, most of them include R source file, data file(s) (see the Data folder) and an additional pdf file explaining the main steps of the project and its conclusions. 

The __MachineLearningExamples__ folder presents small projects involving KNN, K-means, hierarchical clustering, Naive Bayes, SVMs,  ANNs, decision trees, random forest algorithms among others, as well as ways to evaluate model performance and apply cross-validation. 

The __StatInferenceAndPredicitveAnalytics__ folder demonstrates practical examples of statistical inference and predictive analytics, including hypothesis testing ensemble methods (e.g., bagging, 10-fold cross-validation, boosting), association rules (basket analysis), time series analysis, anomaly detection (outlier analysis) and deep learning using H2O package as well as comparison of algorithms' performance indicators. 

All exercises and projects use open datasets specified in the corresponding source files.
