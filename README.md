# Projects in R

This repository contains examples of the learning projects I completed while working on the Master of Science in Data Science degree at the Regis University. Therefore, most of them include R source file, data file(s) (see the Data folder) and an additional pdf file explaining the main steps of the project and its conclusions. 

The __MachineLearningExamples__ folder presents small projects involving KNN, K-means, hierarchical clustering, Naive Bayes, SVMs,  ANNs, decision trees, random forest algorithms among others, as well as ways to evaluate model performance and apply cross-validation. 

All exercises and projects use open datasets specified in the corresponding source files.
