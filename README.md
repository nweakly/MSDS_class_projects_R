# Projects in R

This repository contains examples of the learning projects I completed while working on the Master of Science in Data Science degree at the Regis University. Therefore, most of them include R source file, data file(s) (see the Data folder) and an additional pdf file explaining the main steps of the project and its conclusions.

The examples included in the __DataAnalytics__ folder cover a wide range of analytical tasks from EDA, experimental design and hypothesis testing to applying supervised and non-supervised machine learning methods and linear programming. 

The __MachineLearningExamples__ folder presents small projects involving KNN, K-means, hierarchical clustering, Naive Bayes, SVMs,  ANNs, decision trees, random forest algorithms among others, as well as ways to evaluate model performance and apply cross-validation. 

The __StatInferenceAndPredicitveAnalytics__ folder demonstrates practical examples of statistical inference and predictive analytics, including hypothesis testing ensemble methods (e.g., bagging, 10-fold cross-validation, boosting), association rules (basket analysis), time series analysis, anomaly detection (outlier analysis) and deep learning using H2O package as well as comparison of algorithms' performance indicators.

The __StatMethods__ folder contains examples of various statistical methods and aspects of designing experiments, such as randomized and factorial experimental design, variables choices, simple linear and multiple linear regressions, logistic regression, one- and two-way ANOVA,   as well as non-parametric statistical tests.

All exercises and projects use open datasets specified in the corresponding source files.
